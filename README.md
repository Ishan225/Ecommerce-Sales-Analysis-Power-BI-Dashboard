Interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing ecommerce sales with YTD KPIs and business insights.

Overview:
This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built using US based e commerce sales data to analyze sales performance, profitability, product trends and customer behavior. The dashboard helps in understanding how sales are distributed across regions, states, categories and customer segments, and how performance changes over time.

Objectives:

This includes analyzing overall sales and profit performance, identifying top and bottom performing products, understanding regional and category wise trends, and tracking Year to Date performance using time based analysis.

Key Insights:
The dashboard provides insights such as Top 5 and Bottom 5 products by sales, sales distribution by state and region, category wise and shipping type wise sales, and customer segment analysis including Consumer, Corporate and Home Office segments.

KPIs:
The key performance indicators created in this project include Year to Date Sales, Year to Date Profit, Year to Date Profit Margin, and Year to Date Quantity Sold. These KPIs update dynamically based on selected filters and slicers.

Features:
The dashboard includes interactive slicers for region, state, product category and customer segment. It supports cross filtering and drill down to explore data at different levels. A calendar date table is used to enable time intelligence functions and Year to Date calculations.

Data Preparation:
The raw dataset was cleaned and prepared in Microsoft Excel. This included handling missing values, correcting data formats, standardizing text fields and removing inconsistencies before loading the data into Power BI.

Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel was used for data cleaning and preparation. Power BI was used for data modeling, visualization and dashboard creation. DAX was used to create calculated measures and KPIs.
